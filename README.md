### `Intro`
This is an example of the proof of work used in block generation in nano/banano.
Made this to understand the pow better this could help you if you looking for that :)

#### `Install`
``` bash
npm install --save git+https://github.com/anzerr/banano.pow.git
```

#### `Where to look`
If you want to how the pow works look in ["libary/pow.js"](https://github.com/anzerr/banano.pow/blob/master/libary/pow.js) the other files are just to fork to use the move cores

#### `Around 30 speed`
On a i5-4440 @ 3.10GHz I get around ~~175 kH/s~~ 320kH/s don't know how bad that is compared to other. Probability slow?
